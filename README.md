# The_Hue_game
put the colors in correct order

WORKING!!!

Controls:

S - save current picture
R - create new picture
H - toggle shuffle
F - toggle fullscreen
LMB - swap colors (click on one color, then click on another to swap them)
1-9 - change difficulty (1 = easy, 9 = hard)

How to play:

You have shuffled colors on your screen. You have to put them in correct order to make perfect gradient. Take each corner color as a guide, as they cannot be swapped. If you make whole picture correctly your screen will become green for a second.
